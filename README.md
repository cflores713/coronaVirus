# coronaVirus
Using Differential Equations and Machine Learning models to track the spread and growth rate of the novel COVID-19 virus. The dataset is continuously updated (source: data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases).

To Do:
1.) Establish data preprocessing methods to handle new cases as they come in; rather than manual refinement. This would allow for easier updates as the datasets are brought up to the most recent figures available on a systemic level.

2.) Build Mathematical models to utilize the cleaned dataset.

3.) Use a front end (perhaps Angular or Flutter) to publish the data in a more readable format.
