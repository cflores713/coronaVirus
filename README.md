# coronaVirus
Using Differential Equations and Machine Learning models to track the spread and growth rate of the novel COVID-19 virus.

To Do:
1.) Establish data preprocessing functions to handle data as it comes in; rather than manual refinement.

2.) Build Mathematical models to utilize the cleaned dataset.

3.) Use a front end (perhaps Angular or Flutter) to publish the data in a more readable format.
