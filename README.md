By using publicly available datasets and Machine Learning models you can track the spread of the COVID-19 virus. 

The dataset is continuously updated (source: data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases).

The Jupyter Notebook is designed to explain the design of the code. Most importantly, it gives a working example of Pandas & Seaborn tools available in Python. All you have to do is get the most recent spreadsheet and run it through the ipynb file to get today's visualizations.

By understanding what was done to generate the plot you can gain an awareness for the context of the information. Misinformation and sensationalism tends to run amok with those that avoid looking at the data directly.
